# click_the_hero_game
This is apersonal project made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a clicker game.
I intend to make it so that it includes can recod the users score in an array, and tells you if you beat your high score.
I also want to use local storage to save that data.
I want to add a way to input your name and the game uses your name.
